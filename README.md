# SceneGraphVideoViz

This project is the video analog to the [GraphViz](https://github.com/ranjaykrishna/GraphViz) scene graph visualization. While GraphViz visualizes the scene graph of a single frame, SceneGraphVideoViz visualizes the scene graphs of video frames in succession. The locations of nodes and edges in the scene graphs are fixed throughout the video to allow for easy tracking.


### Usage
This project (Python 3.7) uses [pygraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/) 1.3, [cairosvg](https://cairosvg.org/), in addition to some other common packages. (Note that PyGraphViz has a complex installation process.)


### Example Videos
This repo comes with three video examples:
